This is Aman C Patni, passionate and ambitious guy. I have a keen interest in coding since class 5th wheN I first learnt QBasic. Since than I have learned many languages like :

### LOGO, QBasic, C++, Python, Netbeans, SQL. ###

I would love to contribute in open  source as it is best solution to make a powerful project. Getting a chance to work on famous projects and with biggest developers and joining such a great community, it would be my pleasure. Open Source is the future i believe.
